    "readme": "# native-url\n\nA lightweight implementation of Node's [url](http://nodejs.org/api/url.html) interface atop the [URL API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL). Use it instead of the `url` module to reduce your bundle size by around 7.5 kB.\n\nWeighs **1.6 kB gzipped**, works in Node.js 7+ and [all modern browsers](https://caniuse.com/#feat=mdn-api_url):\n\n![Chrome 32, Firefox 19, Safari 7, Edge 12, Opera 19](https://badges.herokuapp.com/browsers?googlechrome=32&firefox=19&safari=7&microsoftedge=12&opera=19)\n\nOlder browsers can be [easily polyfilled](#polyfill-for-older-browsers) without new browsers loading the code.\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\nnpm i native-url\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nconst url = require('native-url');\n\nurl.parse('https://example.com').host // example.com\nurl.parse('/?a=b', true).query // { a: 'b' }\n```\n\n### Usage with Webpack\n\nWhen you use the `url` module, webpack bundles [`node-url`](https://github.com/defunctzombie/node-url) for the browser. You can alias webpack to use `native-url` instead, saving around 7.5kB:\n\n```js\n// webpack.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  // ...\n  resolve: {\n    alias: {\n      url: 'native-url'\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe result is **functionally equivalent** in Node 7+ and all modern browsers.\n\n### Usage with Rollup\n\nRollup does not bundle shims for Node.js modules like `url` by default, but we can add `url` support via `native-url` using aliases:\n\n```js\n// rollup.config.js\nimport resolve from 'rollup-plugin-node-resolve';\nimport alias from '@rollup/plugin-alias';\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  // ...\n  plugins: [\n    resolve(),\n    alias({\n      entries: {\n        url: 'native-url'\n      }\n    })\n  ]\n};\n```\n\nWith this in place, `import url from 'url'` will use `native-url` and keep your bundle small.\n\n## API\n\nRefer Node's [legacy url documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html#url_legacy_url_api) for detailed API documentation.\n\n### `url.parse(urlStr, [parseQueryString], [slashesDenoteHost])`\n\nParses a URL string and returns a URL object representation:\n\n```js\nurl.parse('https://example.com');\n// {\n//   href: 'http://example.com/',\n//   protocol: 'http:',\n//   slashes: true,\n//   host: 'example.com',\n//   hostname: 'example.com',\n//   query: {},\n//   search: null,\n//   pathname: '/',\n//   path: '/'\n// }\n\nurl.parse('/foo?a=b', true).query.a; // \"b\"\n```\n\n### `url.format(urlObj)`\n\nGiven a parsed URL object, returns its corresponding URL string representation:\n\n```js\nurl.format({ protocol: 'https', host: 'example.com' });\n// \"https://example.com\"\n```\n\n### `url.resolve(from, to)`\n\nResolves a target URL based on the provided base URL:\n\n```js\nurl.resolve('/a/b', 'c');\n// \"/a/b/c\"\nurl.resolve('/a/b', '/c#d');\n// \"/c#d\"\n```\n\n## Polyfill for Older Browsers\n\n`native-url` relies on the DOM [URL API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL) to work. For older browsers that don't support the `URL` API, a [polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/url-polyfill) is available.\n\nConveniently, a polyfill is never needed for [browsers that support ES Modules](https://caniuse.com/#feat=es6-module), so we can use `<script nomodule>` to conditionally load it for older browsers:\n\n```html\n<script nomodule src=\"/path/to/url-polyfill.js\"></script>\n```\n",
