    "readme": "# sanitize.css [<img src=\"https://csstools.github.io/sanitize.css/logo.svg\" alt=\"sanitize\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" align=\"right\">][sanitize.css]\n\n[sanitize.css] is a CSS library that provides consistent, cross-browser\ndefault styling of HTML elements alongside useful defaults.\n\nIt is developed alongside [normalize.css], which means every normalization\nis included, and every normalization and opinion are clearly marked and\ndocumented.\n\n## Usage\n\n```html\n<link href=\"https://unpkg.com/sanitize.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" />\n```\n\n### Forms\n\nA separate stylesheet that normalizes form controls without side effects.\n\n```html\n<link href=\"https://unpkg.com/sanitize.css/forms.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" />\n```\n\nA separate stylesheet that sizes form controls without affecting native styles.\n\n```html\n<link href=\"https://unpkg.com/sanitize.css/formsize.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" />\n```\n\n### Typography\n\nA separate stylesheet that normalizes typography using system interface fonts.\n\n```html\n<link href=\"https://unpkg.com/sanitize.css/typography.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" />\n```\n\n### Measure\n\nA separate stylesheet that applies a comfortable measure to the page.\n\n```html\n<link href=\"https://unpkg.com/sanitize.css/measure.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" />\n```\n\n### Install\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save sanitize.css\n```\n\n#### Webpack Usage\n\nImport [sanitize.css] in CSS:\n\n```css\n@import 'sanitize.css';\n@import 'sanitize.css/typography.css';\n@import 'sanitize.css/forms.css';\n```\n\nAlternatively, import [sanitize.css] in JS:\n\n```js\nimport 'sanitize.css';\nimport 'sanitize.css/typography.css';\nimport 'sanitize.css/forms.css';\n```\n\nIn `webpack.config.js`, be sure to use the appropriate loaders:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.css$/,\n        use: [ 'style-loader', 'css-loader' ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## What does it do?\n\n* Normalizes styles for a wide range of elements.\n* Corrects bugs and common browser inconsistencies.\n* Provides common, useful defaults.\n* Explains what code does using detailed comments.\n\n## Features\n\n##### Box sizing defaults to border-box\n\n```css\n*, ::before, ::after {\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n}\n```\n\n##### Backgrounds do not repeat by default\n\n```css\n*, ::before, ::after {\n  background-repeat: no-repeat;\n}\n```\n\n##### Pseudo-elements inherit text decoration and vertical alignment\n\n```css\n::before,\n::after {\n  text-decoration: inherit;\n  vertical-align: inherit;\n}\n```\n\n##### Cursors only change to hint non-obvious interfaces\n\n```css\nhtml {\n  cursor: default;\n}\n```\n\n##### Text has a comfortable line height in all browsers\n\n```css\nhtml {\n  line-height: 1.5;\n}\n```\n\n##### Tabs appear the same on the web as in a typical editor\n\n```css\nhtml {\n  tab-size: 4;\n}\n```\n\n##### Words break to prevent overflow\n\n```css\nhtml {\n  word-break: break-all;\n}\n```\n\n##### Documents do not use a margin for outer padding\n\n```css\nbody {\n  margin: 0;\n}\n```\n\n##### Navigation lists do not include a marker style\n\n```css\nnav ol, nav ul {\n  list-style: none;\n  padding: 0;\n}\n```\n\n##### Media elements align to the text center of other content\n\n```css\naudio, canvas, iframe, img, svg, video {\n  vertical-align: middle;\n}\n```\n\n##### SVGs fallback to the current text color\n\n```css\nsvg:not([fill]) {\n  fill: currentColor;\n}\n```\n\n##### Tables do not include additional border spacing\n\n```css\ntable {\n  border-collapse: collapse;\n}\n```\n\n##### Textareas only resize vertically by default\n\n```css\ntextarea {\n  resize: vertical;\n}\n```\n\n##### Single taps are dispatched immediately on clickable elements\n\n```css\na, area, button, input, label, select, summary, textarea, [tabindex] {\n  -ms-touch-action: manipulation;\n  touch-action: manipulation;\n}\n```\n\n##### ARIA roles include visual cursor hints\n\n```css\n[aria-busy=\"true\"] {\n  cursor: progress;\n}\n\n[aria-controls] {\n  cursor: pointer;\n}\n\n[aria-disabled=\"true\"], [disabled] {\n  cursor: default;\n}\n```\n\n##### Visually hidden content remains accessible\n\n```css\n[aria-hidden=\"false\"][hidden] {\n  display: initial;\n}\n\n[aria-hidden=\"false\"][hidden]:not(:focus) {\n  clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0);\n  position: absolute;\n}\n```\n\n### Typography\n\n[sanitize.css] includes a separate stylesheet for normalizing typography using\nsystem interface fonts.\n\n### Forms\n\n[sanitize.css] includes a separate stylesheet for normalizing forms using\nminimal, standards-like styling.\n\n**Browser**\n\n```html\n<link href=\"https://unpkg.com/sanitize.css/typography.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" />\n```\n\n**Download**\n\nSee https://csstools.github.io/sanitize.css/latest/typography.css\n\n**CDN**\n\nsee https://cdnjs.com/libraries/10up-sanitize.css/typography.css\n\n#### Typography Features\n\n##### The default font is the system ui font\n\n```css\nhtml {\n  font-family:\n    system-ui,\n    /* macOS 10.11-10.12 */ -apple-system,\n    /* Windows 6+ */ Segoe UI,\n    /* Android 4+ */ Roboto,\n    /* Ubuntu 10.10+ */ Ubuntu,\n    /* Gnome 3+ */ Cantarell,\n    /* KDE Plasma 5+ */ Noto Sans,\n    /* fallback */ sans-serif,\n    /* macOS emoji */ \"Apple Color Emoji\",\n    /* Windows emoji */ \"Segoe UI Emoji\",\n    /* Windows emoji */ \"Segoe UI Symbol\",\n    /* Linux emoji */ \"Noto Color Emoji\";\n}\n```\n\n##### Pre-formatted and code-formatted text uses the monospace system ui font\n\n```css\ncode, kbd, pre, samp {\n  font-family:\n    /* macOS 10.10+ */ Menlo,\n    /* Windows 6+ */ Consolas,\n    /* Android 4+ */ Roboto Mono,\n    /* Ubuntu 10.10+ */ Ubuntu Monospace,\n    /* KDE Plasma 5+ */ Noto Mono,\n    /* KDE Plasma 4+ */ Oxygen Mono,\n    /* Linux/OpenOffice fallback */ Liberation Mono,\n    /* fallback */ monospace;\n}\n```\n\n## Differences\n\n[normalize.css] and [sanitize.css] correct browser bugs while carefully testing\nand documenting changes. normalize.css styles adhere to css specifications.\nsanitize.css styles adhere to common developer expectations and preferences.\n[reset.css] unstyles all elements. Both sanitize.css and normalize.css are\nmaintained in sync.\n\n## Browser support\n\n* Chrome (last 3)\n* Edge (last 3)\n* Firefox (last 3)\n* Firefox ESR\n* Opera (last 3)\n* Safari (last 3)\n* iOS Safari (last 2)\n* Internet Explorer 9+\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease read the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) in order to make the\ncontribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nsanitize.css is a project by [Jonathan Neal](https://github.com/jonathantneal),\nbuilt upon normalize.css, a project by\n[Jonathan Neal](https://github.com/jonathantneal),\nco-created with [Nicolas Gallagher](https://github.com/necolas).\n\n[normalize.css]: https://github.com/csstools/normalize.css\n[reset.css]: http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/\n[sanitize.css]: https://github.com/csstools/sanitize.css\n",

These owners may contribute\nto the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further\nproduction of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or\ngreater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of\nothers.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of\nadditional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and\npublicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\n   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and\n   Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\n   to, the following:\n   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n      and translate a Work;\n   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness\n      depicted in a Work;\n   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;\n   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n      a Work;\n   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations\n      thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\n   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\n   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright\n   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\n   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\n   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\n   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer\n   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and\n   to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that\n   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,\n   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet\n   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express\n   Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\n   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\n   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\n   Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the\n   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a\n   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\n   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and\n   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\n   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License\n   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the\n   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally\n   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or\n   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in\n   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any\n   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)\n   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,\n   in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4.
